Assignment 2: Simulating a Roller Coaster
Author		: Max Waldor
USC ID 		: 9436-8925-87

Description: In this assignment, we use Catmull-Rom splines along with OpenGL core profile shader-based texture mapping and Phong shading to create a roller coaster simulation.

Core Credit Features: (Answer these Questions with Y/N; you can also insert comments as appropriate)
======================

1. Uses OpenGL core profile, version 3.2 or higher Y

2. Completed all Levels:
  Level 1 : Y
  level 2 : Y
  Level 3 : Y
  Level 4 : Y
  Level 5 : Y

3. Rendered the camera at a reasonable speed in a continuous path/orientation Y

4. Run at interactive frame rate (>15fps at 1280 x 720) Y

5. Understandably written, well commented code Y

6. Attached an Animation folder containing not more than 1000 screenshots Y

7. Attached this ReadMe File Y

Extra Credit Features: (Answer these Questions with Y/N; you can also insert comments as appropriate)
======================

1. Render a T-shaped rail cross section Y

2. Render a Double Rail Y

3. Made the track circular and closed it with C1 continuity N

4. Any Additional Scene Elements? (list them here) Y - TREX

5. Render a sky-box Y

6. Create tracks that mimic real world roller coaster N

7. Generate track from several sequences of splines Y

8. Draw splines using recursive subdivision N

9. Render environment in a better manner Y

10. Improved coaster normals N

11. Modify velocity with which the camera moves N

12. Derive the steps that lead to the physically realistic equation of updating u N

Additional Features: (Please document any additional features you may have implemented other than the ones described above)
1. 
2.
3.

Open-Ended Problems: (Please document approaches to any open-ended problems that you have tackled)
1. Roller Coaster is often upside down
2. Supports often intersect with lower track
3.

Keyboard/Mouse controls: (Please document Keyboard/Mouse controls if any)
1. S - take 1000 screenshots and write to animations folder
2. R - toggle autorotating view of track from center point
3. X - take individual screenshot
4. ESC - exit the application

Names of the .cpp files you made changes to:
1. hw2.cpp
2. texPipelineProgram.cpp
3.
